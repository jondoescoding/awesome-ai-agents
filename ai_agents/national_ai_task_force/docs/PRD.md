# National AI Task Force Agent: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
The National AI Task Force Agent is a conversational AI assistant designed to provide information and analysis based on the National AI Task Force PDF document.

Users need a way to quickly access relevant information without reading the entire document, while ensuring the information is accurate and contextually appropriate.

### 1.3 Target Users
- Government officials and policymakers
- AI researchers and practitioners
- Industry stakeholders interested in AI governance
- Educators and students studying AI policy
- General public interested in AI policy recommendations

### 1.4 Value Proposition
- Instant access to specific information within the National AI Task Force document
- Contextual understanding of complex policy recommendations
- Consistent, accurate responses based on the source material
- User-friendly interface for conversational interactions
- Maintenance of conversation context across multiple queries
