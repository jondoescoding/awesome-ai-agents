# 🌟 Awesome AI Agents & Workflows

This repository features AI agents and workflows that use large language models (LLMs) to automate everyday busy people tasks.

## 🛠 Agents vs Workflows

**Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.

**Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

## 🤔 Why Awesome AI Agents & Workflows?

- ⚙ Discover practical and creative ways that AI can be applied across different domains, from your inbox to creating unique content.
- 🥽 Dive into apps that combine LLMs from OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, and open-source alternatives.
- 🎓 Learn from well-documented projects and contribute to the growing open-source ecosystem of LLM-powered agents and workflows.
